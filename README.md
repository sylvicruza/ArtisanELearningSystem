The aim of this project is to develop an AI-based e-learning platform that offers interactive courses and personalized learning paths for users to learn artisan skills. The platform will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to provide a more engaging and effective learning experience for users. The proposed e-learning platform will be developed using modern web development technologies such as React.js, C# ASP .NET MVC, and MSSQL. The platform will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate and access courses, exercises, and quizzes. The platform will also have a recommendation engine that suggests personalized learning paths for users based on their interests and learning objectives. Additionally, the platform will have a chatbot that provides instant feedback and support to users. The development of an AI-based e-learning platform for artisan skills is a challenging but rewarding task. By leveraging modern web development technologies and machine learning techniques, we can provide a more engaging and effective learning experience for users.
